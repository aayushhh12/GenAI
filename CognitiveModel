Cognitive Model: Coin Collecting Game
Perception
Input: Visual stimuli from the game interface, including tracks, player character, coins, and obstacles.
Processing: Observing the game elements, identifying coin locations, and assessing track layout.
Attention
Selection: Focusing attention on the player character's position and nearby coins.
Sustainment: Maintaining attention on moving the player character and tracking coin positions.
Memory
Working Memory: Temporarily storing information about current track, player position, and coin locations.
Long-term Memory: Recalling strategies, past experiences, and learned gameplay mechanics.
Decision Making
Evaluation: Assessing the risk-reward trade-offs of moving the player character to collect coins.
Strategy Formation: Planning movements to maximize coin collection while minimizing collisions.
Motor Control
Execution: Transmitting motor commands to navigate the player character left or right on the tracks.
Coordination: Integrating visual feedback with motor responses to adjust player movements in real-time.
Feedback and Learning
Error Detection: Recognizing missed coin collections or collisions with obstacles.
Adaptation: Modifying gameplay strategies based on feedback to improve future performance.
Skill Acquisition: Learning optimal movement patterns and refining motor skills through repeated gameplay.
Emotion and Motivation
Arousal: Experiencing excitement or frustration based on gameplay outcomes.
Intrinsic Motivation: Seeking enjoyment, challenge, and achievement from playing the game.
Extrinsic Motivation: Striving for high scores, achievements, or social recognition within gaming communities.
Meta-cognition
Awareness: Monitoring one's own cognitive processes and performance during gameplay.
Self-regulation: Adjusting attention, decision-making, and motor control strategies to improve gameplay efficiency.
Summary
The cognitive model outlines the complex interplay between perception, attention, memory, decision-making, motor control, feedback, emotion, motivation, and meta-cognition during gameplay. Players engage in dynamic cognitive processes to navigate the game environment, collect coins, avoid obstacles, and optimize their performance over time.
