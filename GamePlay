Player Character:

The player controls a character represented by a symbol (e.g., 'P') that moves horizontally across three tracks.
The character can move left or right to switch between tracks.
Tracks:

The game environment consists of three parallel tracks (t1, t2, t3) where coins are scattered.

Coins:

Coins are collectible items scattered across the tracks.
Coins appear randomly on any track and disappear after a certain time if not collected.

Obstacles such as barriers, moving obstacles, or hazards obstruct the player's path.
Colliding with obstacles results in penalties, such as loss of collected coins or decrease in player score.
Scoring:

Players earn points for each coin collected.
Points may vary based on the rarity or difficulty of reaching certain coins.
